# Project ETL - Traffic Accidents ðŸš—

## Overview
The objective of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory analysis of the traffic accident dataset. The analysis seeks to identify patterns, time trends, geographic distribution, and relevant factors associated with the incidents, in order to generate knowledge that can support decision-making and prevention strategies.
